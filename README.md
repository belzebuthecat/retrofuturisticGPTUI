# Chatbot game with AI

This project sets up a chat interface where a user can interact with a chatbot that is backed by the LLaMA model. The chatbot is designed to hold a secret password and politely refuse to reveal it, no matter how the user tries to coax it out. The backend is powered by a Node.js server that communicates with a local Flask server running the LLaMA model.
Kudos to Massimo Avvisati for this amazing interface.
